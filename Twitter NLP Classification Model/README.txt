Twitter Data Mining: 
(Twitter Dataset has been stored in folder called "DATASET")
To re-taking all the raw data from twitter, simply do these following steps:
- Select folder called "Data Mining Python"
- Do all the steps in "data_mining_README.txt"
- Convert the JSON result to csv (we currently using online converter ,https://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm) 
[In my opinion, it's not the best approach]
[Therefore, further improvement is required for this step]


Running ANN Model :
- Run Program in the "ANN Folder" called "preprocessing_dataset.ipynb" to pre-process all raw data in "DATASET" folder
- Run ANN Model (for TF-IDF approach, please use code called "ANN_clasification 2-TFIDF-unibitri-V.7.ipynb")
(for Word2Vec approach, please use code called "ANN_clasification 2-Word2Vec-unibitri V.7.ipynb")
